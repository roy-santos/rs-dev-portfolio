            I am a software engineer based in Long Beach, CA. I recently graduated from Western 
            Governor’s University with a BS degree in computer science. Although my professional background
            is mainly in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, I am a lifelong enthusiast of all things tech.
            Continuously learning and improving is what I do and solving real world problems through code is what
            I am passionate about.
