            I am career changer with 4 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry 
            but a lifelong enthusiast of all things tech. I recently completed my bachelor's 
            degree in computer science and I believe that a lot of the skills gained through 
            my previous experiences will translate well into being a great developer. 
          </br></br> 
          Take a look at my portfolio and linked accounts. I am available for new 
          opportunities. <i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
